Hi, I'm Yancy! who are you?  Please feel free to email me email@yancy.lol.

I studied Computer Science at the [University of Minnesota (Twin Cities)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota) with an emphasis on systems programming and computer networks.  I've also studied cryptography at Stanford [online](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/LG3FS2LSRCEK).  Since 2011, I've worked as a software engineer on many different types of projects and last worked with [Crypto Garage](https://cryptogarage.co.jp/en) in [Tokyo Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo).

Currently I'm traveling!
