[This blog](https://github.com/yancyribbens/yancylol) is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a static site generator and hosted as a [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) DigitalOcean Droplet.  I selected Digital Ocean as it was the only service I could find that supported FreeBSD.  Another popular option is to use Github pages in concert with Jekyll as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll), however after reading through the setup, I thought it was simpler to perform the hosting myself.  While reading the documentation, I discovered an interesting [Jekyll plugin](http://jekyll.github.io/github-metadata/) for integrating Github repositories which I may incorporate in the future.

As noted before, this blog is hosted using FreeBSD and I created a simple [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yancyribbens/jail-scripts/main/install-jekyl.sh) to install the Jekyll dependencies.  Also, I opted to try [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html) this time over Apache to host the content generated by Jekyll. Once the install script is run on FreeBSD the steps I took to host the blog are:

Clone the repo to a directory called ~/Git
{% highlight shell %}
git clone https://github.com/yancyribbens/yancylol.git ~/Git
{% endhighlight %}

Build the site
{% highlight shell %}
cd ~/Git/yancylol && jekyll build
{% endhighlight %}

Make a directory for hosting
{% highlight shell %}
mkdir -p /data/www
{% endhighlight %}

Make a symlink from the hosted directory to the site build location
{% highlight shell %}
ln -s ~/git/yancylol/\_site yancy.lol
{% endhighlight %}

Edit nginx.conf
{% highlight shell %}
vim /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
{% endhighlight %}

Add a server block
{% highlight nix %}
server {
    location / {
        root /data/www;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Start the service
{% highlight shell %}
service nginx onestart
{% endhighlight %}
